# Comfyui-PanoCard
A plugin application that utilizes ComfyUI to generate 360-degree panoramic images. It primarily works by converting between flat images and equidistant cylindrical projections, stretching flat images into a curved format, and setting regional conditions, while harnessing the power of large models to produce 360-degree panoramic views.
